**One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka _style guide_).**

**The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person**. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use _Hungarian style_, _Pascal casing_, _Camel casing_, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent with typical industry practices. %%If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.%%

:bulb: IDEs can help to enforce some parts of a coding standard e.g. indentation rules.
