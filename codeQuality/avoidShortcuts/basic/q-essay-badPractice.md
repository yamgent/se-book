Which of these are unsafe coding practices?

- [ ] a. `case` statements without a `default` clause

- [ ] b. Omitting braces when a code block has only one statement

    e.g writing this
    
    ```
    if(isProper)
        return PROPER_AMOUNT;
    ```
    
    instead of
    
    ```
    if(isProper){
        return PROPER_AMOUNT;
    }
    ```

- [ ] c. Using a variable just to explain whatâ€™s going on

    e.g.writing this
    
    ```
    boolean isProper = notNull && notEmpty;
    return isProper;
    ```
    
    instead of
    
    ```
    return notNull && notEmpty;
    ```

a, b.
 
Reason why [c] is not a bad practice: The extra variable helps to make the code more understandable because it makes the intent of the formula clearer.
