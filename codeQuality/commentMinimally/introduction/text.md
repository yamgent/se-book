> Good code is its own best documentation. As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?’ Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer. <sub>--[Steve McConnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McConnell), Author of _Clean Code_</sub>

Some think commenting heavily increases the 'code quality'. This is not so. Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Improve the code to make it self-explanatory.
