<panel header="Q: Big-bang integration in school projects">
<question has-input="true">

Give two arguments in support and two arguments against the following statement.

_Because there is no external client, it is OK to use big bang integration for a school project._

<div slot="answer">

Arguments for:

*	It is relatively simple; even big-bang can succeed.
*	Project duration is short; there is not enough time to integrate in steps.
*	The system is non-critical, non-production (demo only); the cost of integration issues is relatively small.

Arguments against:

*	Inexperienced developers; big-bang more likely to fail
*	Too many problems may be discovered too late. Submission deadline (fixed) can be missed.
*	Team members have not worked together before; increases the probability of integration problems.
