In software development, there are certain problems that recur in a certain context.

<tip-box>

{{ icon_example }} Some examples of recurring design problems:

| Design Context  | Recurring Problem
| --------------- | -----------------
| Assembling a system that makes use of other existing systems implemented using different technologies | What is the best architecture?
| UI needs to be updated when the data in application backend changes | How to initiate an update to the UI when data changes without coupling the backend to the UI? 

</tip-box>

After repeated attempts at solving such problems, better solutions are discovered and refined over time. These solutions are known as design patterns, **a term popularized by the seminal book** [**_Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_ by the so-called "Gang of Four" (GoF)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) written by Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson,and John Vlissides.
