Here are some common elements of a design pattern: Name, Context, Problem, Solution, Anti-patterns (optional), Consequences (optional), other useful information (optional).


Using similar elements, describe a pattern that is not a design pattern. It must be a pattern you have noticed, not a pattern already documented by others. You may also give a pattern not related to software.

Some examples:

* A pattern for testing textual UIs.
* A pattern for striking a good bargain at a mall such as Sim-Lim Square.
