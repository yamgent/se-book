**Design pattern provides a high-level vocabulary to talk about design.**

<tip-box> 

{{ icon_example }} Someone can say 'apply Observer pattern here' instead of having to describe the mechanics of the solution in detail.

**Knowing more patterns is a way to become more ‘experienced’.** Aim to learn at least the context and the problem of patterns %%&nbsp;so that when you encounter those problems you know where to look for a solution%%. 

**Some patterns are domain-specific** %%&nbsp;e.g. patterns for distributed applications%%, **some are created in-house** %%&nbsp;e.g. patterns in the company/project%% and **some can be self-created** %%&nbsp;e.g. from past experience%%.

**Be careful not to overuse patterns.** Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed. Before applying a pattern, make sure that:
* there is substantial improvement in  the design, not just superficial.
* the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).
