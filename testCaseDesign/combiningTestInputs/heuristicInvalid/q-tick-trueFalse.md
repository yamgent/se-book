<question>

Applying the heuristics covered so far, we can determine the precise number of test cases required to test any given SUT effectively.

- ( ) True
- ( ) False

<div slot="answer">

False

Explanation: These heuristics are, well, heuristics only. They will help you to make better decisions about test case design. However, they are speculative in nature (especially, when testing in black-box fashion) and cannot give you precise number of test cases.
