<div id="body">

**_Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)_ is test case design heuristic that is based on the observation that bugs often result from incorrect handling of boundaries of equivalence partitions.** This is not surprising, as the end points of the boundary are often used in branching instructions etc. where the programmer can make mistakes.

<tip-box> 

{{ icon_example }} `markCellAt(int x, int y)` operation could contain code such as if `(x > 0 && x <= (W-1))` which involves boundaries of xâ€™s equivalence partitions.

</tip-box>
 

**BVA suggests that when picking test inputs from an equivalence partition, values near boundaries (i.e. boundary values) are more likely to find bugs.**

Boundary values are sometimes called _corner cases_.
