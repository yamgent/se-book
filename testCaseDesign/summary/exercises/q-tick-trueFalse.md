We can apply equivalence partitioning technique in white-box fashion.

- [ ] a. True
- [ ] b. False

<div slot="answer">

- [x] a. True
- [ ] b. False

Explanation: In fact, when we know about how the SUT is implemented, we can make more informed decisions about partitioning test input into equivalence partitions. White-box equivalence partitioning is less speculative than black-box equivalence partitioning.
