If you download a pre-release version of a new game (executable file) to do a test drive and submit bug reports, you would be doing

- [ ] a. white-box exploratory testing
- [ ] b. gray-box beta testing
- [ ] c. black-box exploratory testing
- [ ] d. black-box scripted testing

<div slot="answer">

- [ ] a. white-box exploratory testing
- [ ] b. gray-box beta testing
- [x] c. black-box exploratory testing
- [ ] d. black-box scripted testing

Explanation: Since it is an executable only, you are unlikely to have a knowledge of its internal workings. Therefore, your testing is most likely to be black-box testing. A ‘test drive’ sounds like exploratory testing rather than scripted testing.
