<div slot="answer">

- (x) d. Prototyping can be used to discover as well as record requirements.

Explanation:

* Functional requirements are not *always* more important.
* Greenfield projects do not have existing products.
* Users can inform us about the present. They may not be able to envision the future. (It’s not the consumers’ job to know what they want --Steve Jobs).
