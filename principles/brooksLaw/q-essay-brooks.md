<question has-input="true">

Do the Brook’s Law apply to a school project? Justify.

<div slot="answer">

Yes. Adding a new student to a project team can result in a slow-down of the project for a short period. This is because the new member needs time to learn the project and existing members will have to spend time helping the new guy get up to speed. If the project is already behind schedule and near a deadline, this could delay the delivery even further.
