          <p><strong>YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It!) Principle</strong>: Do not add code simply because ‘you might need it in the future’.</p>
        </div>
      </tip-box>
      <p>The principle says that some capability we presume our software needs in the future should not be built now because the chances are &quot;you aren't gonna need it&quot;. The rationale is that we do not have perfect information about the future and
        therefore some of the extra work we do to fulfill a potential future need might go to waste when some of our predictions fail to materialize.</p>
