- [x] a. It can complicate the design/implementation by introducing extra abstractions, but it has some benefits.
- [ ] b. It is often used during testing, to replace dependencies with mocks.
- [ ] c. It reduces dependencies in a design.
- [ ] d. It advocates making higher level classes to depend on lower level classes.
