      <p><strong>The Open-Close Principle aims to make a code entity easy to adapt and reuse without needing to modify the code entity itself.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong>: A module should be <em>open</em> for extension but <em>closed</em> for modification. That is, modules should be written so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. <sub>-- proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer">Bertrand Meyer</a></sub></p>
        </div>
      </tip-box>
      <p>In object-oriented programming, OCP can be achieved in various ways. This often requires separating the <em>specification (i.e. interface)</em> of a module from its <em>implementation</em>.</p>

        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> In the design given below, the behavior of the <code>CommandQueue</code> class can be altered by adding more concrete <code>Command</code> subclasses. For example, by including a <code>Delete</code> class alongside
          <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset</code>, the <code>CommandQueue</code> can now perform delete commands without modifying its code at all. That is, its behavior was extended without having to modify its code. Hence, it was
          open to extensions, but closed to modification.</p>

        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> The behavior of a Java generic class can be altered by passing it a different class as a parameter. In the code below, the <code>ArrayList</code> class behaves as a container of <code>Students</code> in one instance
          and as a container of <code>Admin</code> objects in the other instance, without having to change its code. That is, the behavior of the <code>ArrayList</code> class is extended without modifying its code.</p>

ArrayList admins = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ArrayList&lt; Admin &gt;();
