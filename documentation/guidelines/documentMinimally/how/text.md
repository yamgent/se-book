<div id="body">

Anything that is already clear in the code need not be described in words. Instead, **focus on providing higher level information that is not readily visible in the code or comments**.

Refrain from duplicating chunks or text. When describing several similar algorithms/designs/APIs, etc., do not simply duplicate large chunks of text. Instead, **describe the similarity in one place and emphasize only the differences in other places.** It is very annoying to see pages and pages of similar text without any indication as to how they differ from each other.
