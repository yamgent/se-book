It is recommended for developer documents,

- [ ] a. to have separate sections for each type of diagrams such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams etc.
- [ ] b. to give a high priority to comprehension too, not stop at comprehensiveness only.

<div slot="answer">

~~(a)~~(b)

Explanation:

(a) Use diagrams when they help to understand the text descriptions. Text and diagrams should be used in tandem. Having separate sections for each diagram type is a sign of generating diagrams for the sake of having them.

(b) Both are important, but lengthy, complete, accurate yet hard to understand documents are not that useful.
