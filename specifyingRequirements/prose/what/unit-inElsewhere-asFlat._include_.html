      <p><strong>A textual description (i.e. <em>prose</em>) can be used to describe requirements.</strong> Prose is especially useful when describing abstract ideas such as the vision of a product.</p>

        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> The product vision of the <a href="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates">TEAMMATES Project</a> given below is described using prose.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>TEAMMATES aims to become <strong>the biggest student project in the world</strong> (<em>biggest</em> here refers to 'many contributors, many users, large code base, evolving over a long period'). Furthermore, it aims to serve as a training tool
            for Software Engineering students who want to learn SE skills in the context of <strong>a non-trivial real software product</strong>.</p>
