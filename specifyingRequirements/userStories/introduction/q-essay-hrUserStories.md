<question has-input="true">

Bill wants you to build a Human Resource Management (HRM) system. He mentions that _the system will help employees to view their own <popover content="The number of leave days not yet taken">leave balance</popover>_. What are the user stories you can extract from that statement?

<div slot="hint">

Remember to follow the correct format when writing user stories.
<include src="../../../common/definitions.md#def-user-story-format" />

<div slot="answer">

`As an employee, I can view my leave balance, so that I can know how many leave days I have left.`

%%Note: the `{benefit}` part may vary as it is not specifically mentioned in the question.%%
