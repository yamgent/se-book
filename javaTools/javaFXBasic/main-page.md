# JavaFx 9 tutorial

Adapted (with permissions) from [Marco Jakob's JavaFX 8 tutorial](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/). Thanks to [Marco Jakob](https://github.com/marcojakob) for allowing us to adapt his tutorials for IntelliJ.

Table of contents:

* [Part 1: Scene Builder](part01/part01.md)
* [Part 2: Model and TableView](part02/part02.md)

After going through the two parts, you should be familiar with working with IntelliJ. You can continue with the original tutorial (which is written for Eclipse), with the following links:

* [Part 3: Interacting with the User](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/part3/)
* [Part 4: CSS Styling](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/part4/)
* [Part 5: Storing Data as XML](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/part5/)
