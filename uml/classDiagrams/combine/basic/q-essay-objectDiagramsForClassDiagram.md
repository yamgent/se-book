<question>

Suppose we wrote a program to follow the class structure given in this class diagram:

<img src="{{baseUrl}}/modeling/modelingStructures/classDiagramsBasic/images/typicalClasssStructure.png" width="400" />
<p/>

Draw object diagrams to represent the object structures after each of these steps below. Assume that we are trying to minimize the number of total objects.

i.e. apply step 1 → [diagram 1] → apply step 2 on diagram 1 → [diagram 2] and so on.

1. There are no persons.

2. `Alfred` is the Guardian of `Bruce`.

3. `Bruce`'s contact number is the same as `Alfred`'s.

4. `Alfred` is also the guardian of another person. That person lists `Alfred`s home address as his home address as well as office address.

5. `Alfred` has a an office address at `Wayne Industries` building which is different from his home address (i.e. `Bat Cave`).

After step 2, the diagram should be like this:
