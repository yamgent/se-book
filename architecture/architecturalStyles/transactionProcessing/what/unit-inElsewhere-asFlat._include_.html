      <p><strong>The <em>transaction processing</em> style divides the workload of the system down to a number of <em>transactions</em> which are then given to a <em>dispatcher</em> that controls the execution of each transaction.</strong> Task queuing,
        ordering, undo etc. are handled by the dispatcher.</p>

        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> In this example from a Banking system, transactions are generated by the terminals used by
          <tooltip content="employees of a bank who deals directly with customers">tellers</tooltip> which are then sent to a central dispatching unit which in turn dispatches the transactions to various other units to execute.</p>
