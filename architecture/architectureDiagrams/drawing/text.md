<div id="body">

While architecture diagrams have no standard notation, try to follow these basic guidelines when drawing them.

* Minimize the variety of symbols. If the symbols you choose do not have widely-understood meanings %%&nbsp;e.g. A drum symbol is widely-understood as representing a database%%, explain their meaning.

* Avoid the indiscriminate use of double-headed arrows to show interactions between components.

<tip-box> 

{{ icon_example }} Consider the two architecture diagrams of the same software given below. Because `Diagram 2` uses double headed arrows, the important fact that GUI has a bi-directional dependency with the Logic component is no longer captured.
