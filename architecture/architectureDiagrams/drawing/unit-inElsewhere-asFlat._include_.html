      <p>While architecture diagrams have no standard notation, try to follow these basic guidelines when drawing them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Minimize the variety of symbols. If the symbols you choose do not have widely-understood meanings <span class="dimmed"> e.g. A drum symbol is widely-understood as representing a database</span>, explain their meaning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Avoid the indiscriminate use of double-headed arrows to show interactions between components.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Consider the two architecture diagrams of the same software given below. Because <code>Diagram 2</code> uses double headed arrows, the important fact that GUI has a bi-directional dependency with the Logic component
          is no longer captured.</p>
