<div id="body">

**A _buffer_ is a time set aside to absorb any unforeseen delays.** It is very important to include buffers in a software project schedule because effort/time estimations for software development is notoriously hard. However, **do not inflate task estimates to create hidden buffers**; have explicit buffers instead. %%&nbsp;Reason: With explicit buffers it is easier to detect incorrect effort estimates which can serve as a feedback to improve future effort estimates.%%
