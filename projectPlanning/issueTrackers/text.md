Keeping track of project tasks %%(who is doing what, which tasks are ongoing, which tasks are done etc.)%% is an essential part of project management. In small projects it may be possible to track tasks using simple tools as online spreadsheets or general-purpose/light-weight tasks tracking tools such as Trello. Bigger projects need more sophisticated task tracking tools. 

**Issue trackers (sometimes called bug trackers) are commonly used to track task assignment and progress.** Most online project management software such as GitHub, SourceForge, and BitBucket come with an integrated issue tracker.
