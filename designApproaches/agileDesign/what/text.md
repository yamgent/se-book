**_Agile design_ can be contrasted with _full upfront design_ in the following way**:

>**Agile designs are emergent, theyâ€™re not defined up front.** Your overall system design will emerge over time, evolving to fulfill new requirements and take advantage of new technologies as appropriate. Although you will often do **some initial architectural modeling at the very beginning** of a project, this will be just enough to get your team going. This approach does not produce a fully documented set of models in place before you may begin coding. <sub>-- adapted from [agilemodeling.com](http://agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDesign.htm)</sub>
