**An object is an _encapsulation_ of some data and related behavior in two aspects:**

**1. The _packaging_ aspect:** An object packages data and related behavior together into one self-contained unit.

**2. The _information hiding_ aspect:** The data in an object is hidden from the outside world and are only accessible using the object's interface.
