Which statements are correct?

- [ ] a. An object is an abstraction of [data + related functions]
- [ ] b. An object is an abstraction of [state + related behavior]
- [ ] c. An object can contain instance variables and methods
- [ ] d. An object is an instance of a class
- [ ] e. An object should not depend on another object

<div slot="answer">

a, b, c, d

Explanation: (a) and (b) means the same concept (the ‘state’ of an object is represented by the data values it holds). The third statement explains how that concept  is implemented at code level. Objects can interact with other objects to perform various tasks and therefore may depend on other objects.
