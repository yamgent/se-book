You can use the `stage` or the `add` command (they are synonyms, `add` is the more popular choice) to stage files.

```sh
git add fruits.txt
git status
```
{{ icon_output }}
```sh
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       new file:   fruits.txt
#
```
