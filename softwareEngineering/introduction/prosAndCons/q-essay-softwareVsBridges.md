Comment on this statement: Building software is cheaper and easier than building bridges (all we need is a PC!).

<div slot="answer">

Depends on the size of the software. Manpower required for software is very costly. On the other hand, we can create a very valuable software (e.g. an iPhone application that can make million dollars in a month) with a just a PC and a few days of work!
