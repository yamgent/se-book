**The _sequential model_, also called the _waterfall_ model, models software development as a linear process**, in which the project is seen as progressing steadily in one direction through the development stages. The name _waterfall_ stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).

**When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage.** For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see no further modifications. A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.

**This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable.** In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well. As each stage has a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.

**The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time.** One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software application can be used without prior experience in using a similar application.
