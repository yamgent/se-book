<question>

In general, which has a higher risk of overshooting a deadline?

- ( ) a. The iterative process.
- ( ) b. The sequential process.
- ( ) c. The risk is similar.

<div slot="answer">

(b)

Explanation: An iterative process can meet a deadline better than a sequential process. If the last iteration got delayed, we can always deliver the previous version. However, this does not guarantee that all features promised at the beginning will be delivered on the deadline.
