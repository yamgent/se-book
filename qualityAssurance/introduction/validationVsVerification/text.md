**Quality Assurance = Validation + Verification**

QA involves checking two aspects:

1. Validation: are we _building the right system_ i.e., are the requirements correct? 
2. Verification: are we _building the system right_ i.e., are the requirements implemented correctly?

Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).
