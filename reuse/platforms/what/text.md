**A _platform_ provides a runtime environment for applications.** A platform is often bundled with various libraries, tools, frameworks, and technologies in addition to a runtime environment but the defining characteristic of a software platform is the presence of a runtime environment.

{{ icon_example }} Technically, an operating system can be called a platform. For example, Windows PC is a platform for desktop applications while iOS is a platform for mobile apps.

{{ icon_example }} **Two well-known examples of platforms are JavaEE and .NET**, both of which sit above Operating systems layer, and are used to develop <trigger for="modal:enterprise-application" trigger="click">enterprise applications</trigger>. Infrastructure services such as connection pooling, load balancing, remote code execution, transaction management, authentication, security, messaging etc. are done similarly in most enterprise applications. Both JavaEE and .NET provide these services to applications in a customizable way without developers having to implement them from scratch every time.

* JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) is both a framework and a platform for writing enterprise applications. The runtime used by the JavaEE applications is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that can run on different Operating Systems.
* .NET is a similar platform and a framework. Its runtime is called CLR (Common Language Runtime) and usually used on Windows machines.
