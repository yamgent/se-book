(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)~~(f)~~

Explanation: While both libraries and frameworks are reuse mechanisms, and both more concrete than principles and patterns, libraries differ from frameworks in some key ways. One of them is the ‘inversion of control’ used by frameworks but not libraries. Furthermore, frameworks do not have to be bigger than libraries all the time.
