<panel header="{{ icon_Q_A }} Using a cool UI framework">
<question has-input="true">

One of your teammates is proposing to use a recently-released “cool” UI framework for your class project. List the pros and cons of this idea.

<div slot="answer">

Pros

* The potential to create a much better product by reusing the framework.
* Learning a new framework is good for the future job prospects.

Cons

* Learning curve may be steep.
* May not be stable (it was recently released).
* May not allow us to do exactly what we want. While frameworks allow customization, such customization can be limited.
* Performance penalties.
* Might interfere with learning objectives of the module.

Note that having more cons does not mean we should not use this framework. Further investigation is required before we can make a final decision.
