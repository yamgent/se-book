Which team structure is the most suitable for a school project?

- ( ) a. Egoless
- ( ) b. Chief programmer
- ( ) c. Strict hierarchy

<div slot="answer">

(a)

Explanation: Given that students are all peers and beginners, Egoless team structure seems most suitable for a school project. However, given school projects are low-stakes, short-lived, and small, even the other two team structures can be used for them.
