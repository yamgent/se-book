Which approach is better – **scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.**

**The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.** Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled or inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While **exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system**.

**Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time**, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar systems.  

> In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations benefit from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches.
