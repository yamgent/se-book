**Test-Driven Development(TDD)_ advocates writing the tests before writing the SUT, while evolving functionality and tests in small increments**. In TDD you first define the precise behavior of the SUT using test cases, and then write the SUT to match the specified behavior. While TDD has its fair share of detractors, there are many who consider it a good way to reduce defects. One big advantage of TDD is that it guarantees the code is testable.
