      <p><strong>Measuring coverage is often done using <em>coverage analysis tools</em>.</strong> Most IDEs have inbuilt support for measuring test coverage, or at least have plugins that can measure test coverage.</p>
      <p><strong>Coverage analysis can be useful in improving the quality of testing</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., if a set of test cases does not achieve 100% branch coverage, more test cases can be added to cover missed branches</span>.</p>
