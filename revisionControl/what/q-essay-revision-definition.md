In the context of RCS, what is a _Revision_? Give an example.

<div slot="answer">

A _revision_ (some seem to use it interchangeably with _version_ while others seem to distinguish the two -- here, let us treat them as the same, for simplicity) is a state of a piece of information at a specific time that is a result of some changes to it. For example, take a file containing program code. If you modify the code and save the file, you have a new revision (or a version) of that file.
