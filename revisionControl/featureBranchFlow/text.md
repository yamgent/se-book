<div id="body">

**_Feature branch_ workflow is similar to forking workflow except there are no forks.** Everyone is pushing/pulling from the same remote repo. The phrase _feature branch_ is used because each new feature (or bug fix, or any other modification) is done in a separate branch and merged to `master` branch when ready.
