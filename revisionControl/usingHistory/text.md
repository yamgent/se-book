#### Using History

</div>

<div id="body">

**<trigger for="pop:rcs">RCS</trigger> tools store the history of the working directory as a series of commits.** This means we should commit after each change that we want the RCS to 'remember' for us.
 
**To see what changed between two points of the history, you can ask the RCS tool to  ==_diff_== the two commits in concern.**

**To restore the state of the working directory at a point in the past, you can ==_checkout_== the commit in concern.** i.e., we can traverse the history of the working directory simply by checking out the commits we are interested in.
