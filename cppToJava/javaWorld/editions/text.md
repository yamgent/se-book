* **Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)**: Contains the core functionality of the Java programming language.

* **Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)**: For developing and running large-scale enterprise applications. Built on top of Java SE.

* **Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)**: For Java programming language applications meant for small devices, like mobile phones. A subset of Java SE.

* **JavaFX**: For creating applications with graphical user interfaces. Can work with the other three above.

This book chapter uses the Java SE edition unless stated otherwise.
