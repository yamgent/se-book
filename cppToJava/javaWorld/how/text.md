**Java is both <tooltip content="generates machine code from source code before executing the program">_compiled_</tooltip> and <tooltip content="the interpreter executes the program directly, one statement at a time">_interpreted_</tooltip>.** Instead of translating programs directly into machine language, the Java compiler generates _byte code_. Byte code is _portable_, so it is possible to compile a Java program on one machine, transfer the byte code to another machine, and run the byte code on the other machine. That’s why Java is considered a _platform independent technology_, aka _WORA_ (Write Once Run Anywhere). The interpreter that runs byte code is called a “Java Virtual Machine” (JVM).

>**Java technology is both a _programming language_ and a _platform_.** The Java programming language is a high-level object-oriented language that has a particular syntax and style. A Java platform is a particular environment in which Java programming language applications run. <small>--[Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/firstcup/doc/gkhoy.html)</small>
