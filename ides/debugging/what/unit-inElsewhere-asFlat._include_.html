      <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <font color="red"><span><strong><span class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span> Bad</strong>
              </span>
            </font> -- <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
            This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
            <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
            <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <font color="red"><span><strong><span class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span> Bad</strong>
              </span>
            </font> -- <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
            <li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <font color="green"><span><strong><span class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span> Good</strong>
              </span>
            </font> -- <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>
