      <ul>
        <li>Is this class structure is able to produce the behavior we want?</li>
        <li>What API should each class have?</li>
        <li>Do we need more classes?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To answer those questions, you can analyze the how the objects of these classes will interact with each other to produce the behavior you want.</p>
