- ( ) c. One shows more details than the other.
- ( ) d. One is a UML diagram, while the other is not a UML diagram.

Explanation: Both are UML diagrams, and use the class diagram notation. While it is true that often a class diagram may have more classes and more details, the main difference is that the OO domain model describes the problem domain while the class diagram describes the solution.
