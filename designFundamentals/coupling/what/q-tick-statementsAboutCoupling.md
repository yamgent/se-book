- [ ] a. As coupling increases, testability decreases.
- [ ] b. As coupling increases, the risk of regression increases.
- [ ] c. As coupling increases, the value of automated regression testing increases.
- [ ] d. As coupling increases, integration becomes easier as everything is connected together.
- [ ] e. As coupling increases, maintainability decreases.

(a)(b)(c)~~(d)~~(e)
